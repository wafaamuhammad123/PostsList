# Getting Started with Create React App

## Project idea
This project is a simple CRUD application for managing posts, where users can add, edit, and delete posts.

## Prerequisites
Before you can run the project, make sure you have the following installed:
-Nodejs
-npm

## Getting Started
1-Clone the repository (ex: git clone https://github.com/your-username/project-name.git)
2-cd project-name
3-Install dependencies (ex:npm install)
4-Start the development server (ex: npm start)

## Notes
-API Source: The project uses a placeholder API (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts) for fetching posts data
-Local Storage: Posts are saved in the browser's localStorage to persist data across sessions
-UI/UX: The UI is relatively simple and is based on Ant Design components.

## Challenges

1-State Management: Managing the state of multiple modals (Add, Edit, Delete) 
2-Asynchronous Data Fetching like handling the fetching of posts from the API and integrating it with localStorage

## Total Time Spent

Total Time Spent: Approximately 8-9 hours
